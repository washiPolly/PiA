# PiA - Personal Inventory Assistant

## About PiA

Have you ever been in a situation where you saw a Tie or dress shirt you needed for an outfit but wasn't sure if it would match? Or do you have an upcoming event and wasn't sure if there was already something in your Closet you can wear?

What about having a comprehensive database storing your Collectibles inventory you can easily find, review, and trade from?

Would it be nice to have your warranty, insurance documents, or even taxes handy to pull up whenever you needed?

This was the inspiration behind PiA. We wanted to offer a new way to offer Users to store and organize their peronsal inventory.

## Continued Buildling

We would like to offer complete:

1. Budgeting
2. Affliates programs for Online Shopping
3. Comprehensive Database Search
4. Full Calendar integrations
5. Alerts and Reminders for Collectible items
